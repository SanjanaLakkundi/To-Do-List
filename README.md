Key Points in Code

HTML Structure:
Organized using a container for input and task list elements.
Form elements include an input field for new tasks and buttons for adding tasks.

Styling with CSS:
Aesthetic elements such as colors, borders, and spacing are defined to improve visual appeal.
Responsive styles are applied using media queries to adjust layouts based on screen size.

JavaScript Functionality:
Event listeners are set up to handle user actions, like adding a task and marking it as completed.
Functions are defined for adding, editing, and deleting tasks, and for updating the local storage.

Local Storage Integration:
Tasks are saved in local storage so that they persist even after the page is refreshed.
Functions are included to retrieve tasks from local storage when the app loads.

User Interaction:
The app provides feedback when actions are performed (e.g., showing alerts for invalid input).
Clear buttons for editing and deleting tasks enhance user control over their to-do list.

Validation:
Input validation ensures that empty tasks cannot be added, prompting the user for valid input.
